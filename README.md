Udacity Nanodegree Program - iOS Developer

The Udacity Nanodegree program was a great opportunity for me to get a deep insight into Swift and Xcode.
During the course I built 6 different applications from scratch and learned a lot about UIKit, Networking, CoreData and how to build own Apps from scratch.
  
Project 1 - Pitch Perfect
* Understanding Swift Basics

Project 2 - MemeMe 1.0
* UIKit Fundamentals

Project 3 - MemeMe 2.0
* UIKit Fundamentals Extended

Project 4 - OnTheMap
* Networking

Project 5 - VirtualTourist
* Data Persistence

Project 6 - FitnessTracker (TODO)
* Data Visualization
